Navigate your snake through the perilous abyss and see how many apples you can eat. There are three different difficulties:<br>
Easy - if your snake hits a wall, they choose a different direction and keep on grooving.<br>
Medium - if your snake hits a wall, game over.<br>
Hard - a bomb is added to the canvas. If your snake touches it, game over.<br>
You may switch between these difficulties at whim, but there is no way to clear a bomb once it has been planted.

<b>Summary</b><br>
This one was fun. I'd already worked on a snake game a few years ago, but that had been with the help of tutorials. I wanted to challenge myself and write one completely from scratch this time. I did nearly all of it in an evening, and am especially proud at implementing the functionality for the snake to hug the borders of the canvas.
