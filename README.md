<b>Summary</b><br>
This one was fun. I'd already worked on a snake game a few years ago, but that had been with the help of tutorials. I wanted to challenge myself and write one completely from scratch this time. I did the whole thing in an evening, and am especially proud at implementing the functionality for the snake to hug the borders of the canvas.
